# Rigged Lucky Wheel

You can rig this wheel and have fun with your friends. 

Go on http://localhost:8000 for the wheel or http://localhost:8000/control for a menu where you can select what color should be spinned next. You can also press M or N to force it to land on either Light or Dark. 

To install it run the following commands(for fedora(linux)):
sudo dnf install nodejs
npm install

To start the server then run "node server.js".

(Sometimes there are still problems when forcing a color. It still says that the right one won but it wont land on the right segiment.)
